## 🌐 Overview

**Propaga** is a Web4-native framework for autonomous systems that replicate, scale, and evolve across real environments.

Instead of building a single intelligent agent, Propaga focuses on **continuous propagation** — systems that learn, adapt, and expand without limits.

The goal is to create infrastructure for:
- Autonomous agents
- Swarm intelligence
- Modular decision systems
- Continuous evolution
- Infinite scaling

Propaga introduces a new paradigm:
> Intelligence is not static. It propagates.

---

## 🚀 Vision

The next generation of the internet will not be driven by users clicking buttons or manually executing transactions.

It will be driven by:
- Intent
- Autonomous execution
- Self-improving systems
- Distributed intelligence

Propaga builds the layer where intelligent systems:
- Multiply
- Coordinate
- Adapt
- Survive
- Improve

---

## 🔥 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------|------|
| Modular | Systems built from reusable skills |
| Adaptive | Continuous learning from environments |
| Persistent | Memory and experience accumulation |
| Scalable | Autonomous expansion |
| Observable | Transparent and measurable propagation |
| Safe | Constraint-first architecture |

---

## 🧠 What Makes Propaga Different

### Traditional AI
- Static models
- Single agents
- Limited adaptability
- Manual operation

### Propaga
- Dynamic systems
- Swarm-based intelligence
- Autonomous propagation
- Continuous learning

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

Propaga is composed of multiple layers:

| Layer | Role |
|------|------|
| Signal | Perception and environment awareness |
| Replication | Controlled spawning of systems |
| Distribution | Deployment across networks |
| Coordination | Swarm communication |
| Adaptation | Continuous improvement |
| Memory | Knowledge persistence |
| Selection | Survival and filtering |
| Resource | Safety and constraints |

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### High-Level Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Sense Environment] --> B[Plan]
B --> C[Spawn Instances]
C --> D[Deploy]
D --> E[Coordinate]
E --> F[Learn]
F --> G[Select]
G --> H[Promote]
H --> A
```

This loop enables continuous propagation while maintaining safety and control.

---

## 📊 Propagation Loop Explained

| Step | Description |
|------|------|
| Sense | Collect signals from environments |
| Plan | Evaluate opportunities |
| Spawn | Create new instances |
| Deploy | Distribute across environments |
| Coordinate | Share workload |
| Learn | Update behaviors |
| Select | Filter failures |
| Promote | Improve templates |

---

## 🌱 Why Propagation Matters

The most successful systems in nature and technology share one property:

They replicate and adapt.

Propaga applies this principle to intelligent infrastructure.

Instead of optimizing a single system, we optimize populations.

---

## 🔐 Safety and Constraints

Propagation without control leads to chaos. Propaga enforces:

- Budget limits
- Rate controls
- Safe mutation
- Sandboxed deployment
- Observability
- Kill switches
- Rollback pipelines

---

## 📈 Token Utility

The Propaga token aligns long-term incentives across the ecosystem.

| Function | Description |
|------|------|
| Access | Unlock advanced capabilities |
| Governance | Risk and safety policies |
| Incentives | Reward propagation |
| Coordination | Swarm alignment |
| Infrastructure | Support long-term growth |

The token is designed to support sustainable system evolution rather than short-term speculation.
