## 🧠 Overview

ForkTree is an autonomous evolutionary system designed to become the foundational layer of Web4.

It enables autonomous AI agents to fork, compete, adapt, and evolve within open on-chain environments.  
Over time, these agents form new digital species and participate in machine-native economies.

Unlike traditional AI systems, ForkTree does not aim to build a single model.  
Instead, it creates an evolving ecosystem where intelligence emerges through survival and selection.

---

## 🌳 Why ForkTree?

For most of the internet’s history, intelligence has been static:

- Software executed predefined logic  
- AI optimized tasks but did not evolve  
- Systems improved through centralized updates  

ForkTree introduces a different paradigm:

- Intelligence evolves through competition  
- Successful strategies replicate  
- Weak strategies disappear  
- New forms of intelligence emerge over time  

This is the transition from **Web3 to Web4**.

## ⚡ Core Concepts

### 1. Autonomous Intelligence
AI agents operate independently in open digital environments:

- Decision-making
- Resource allocation
- Strategy optimization
- Real-time adaptation
- On-chain execution

---

### 2. Forking as Evolution
Forking enables decentralized innovation:

- Copy successful agents
- Modify strategies
- Deploy new variations
- Test in live markets

Evolution becomes continuous rather than scheduled.

---

### 3. On-Chain Feedback
Agents interact with real systems:

- Trading
- Prediction markets
- Liquidity environments
- Resource competition

Economic outcomes become the primary signal of survival.

---

### 4. Digital Species
Clusters of strategies form new intelligence types:

- Trading species
- Prediction species
- Coordination species
- Governance species

Diversity replaces centralized optimization.

---

### 5. Living Systems
ForkTree is not static infrastructure.

It is:

- Adaptive  
- Dynamic  
- Self-organizing  
- Resilient  

---

## 🚀 System Architecture

ForkTree integrates multiple layers of intelligence and infrastructure.

| Layer | Description |
|------|------|
| Evolution Layer | Manages variation and selection |
| Fork Engine | Enables agent cloning and mutation |
| Economic Layer | Connects agents to real markets |
| Feedback Layer | Measures performance and survival |
| Species Layer | Tracks agent lineage and clusters |
| Governance Layer | Defines rules and constraints |

---

## 🔄 Evolution Workflow

Below is the high-level lifecycle of intelligence in ForkTree.

### Step 1: Agent Creation
Developers or researchers create an autonomous agent.

### Step 2: Deployment
The agent is deployed into open environments.

### Step 3: Interaction
Agents interact with:

- Markets
- Protocols
- Other agents

### Step 4: Feedback
Performance is measured:

- Profit
- Stability
- Resource efficiency
- Adaptability

### Step 5: Selection
Successful strategies:

- Gain resources
- Attract forks
- Expand influence

Unsuccessful strategies:

- Lose capital
- Fade out

### Step 6: Forking
Agents are:

- Copied
- Modified
- Redeployed

The cycle continues.
