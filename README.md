## 🌍 Overview

RootDna is a framework for building autonomous agents that continuously learn, adapt, and evolve.  
Instead of static models, RootDna focuses on long-term intelligence, where agents accumulate experience and improve over time.

RootDna enables persistent decision-making systems designed for dynamic environments such as:

- Financial markets  
- Multi-agent simulations  
- Autonomous research  
- Digital economies  
- Adaptive infrastructure  

The goal is to move beyond automation toward evolving intelligence.

## 🧬 Core Ideas

### Modular Intelligence  
Agents are composed of reusable decision modules rather than single models.

### Continuous Learning  
Agents improve through real-world feedback and iteration.

### Persistent Identity  
Each agent maintains memory and behavioral continuity.

### Evolution  
Strategies mutate, recombine, and improve across generations.

## ⚡ Why RootDna

| Traditional AI | RootDna |
|----------------|--------|
| Static models | Evolving agents |
| Periodic retraining | Continuous adaptation |
| Reset learning | Persistent memory |
| Single optimization | Long-term intelligence |
| Limited scalability | Population-level evolution |

---

## 🧠 Architecture

| Layer | Function |
|------|------|
| Perception | Interpret environment |
| Decision | Strategy generation |
| Execution | Action layer |
| Memory | Knowledge accumulation |
| Adaptation | Learning loop |
| Evolution | Mutation and inheritance |

A[Define Agent] --> B[Deploy]
B --> C[Collect Feedback]
C --> D[Adapt]
D --> E[Mutation]
E --> F[Selection]
F --> G[Inheritance]
G --> B
```

This closed loop enables long-term evolution.
